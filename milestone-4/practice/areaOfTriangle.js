 * Write a function to find the area of triagnle if you are give the 3 sides value of triangle

 * In order to find the area of a triangle with 3 sides, we use the Heron's formula which says if a, b, and c are the three sides of a triangle, then its area is,

Area = âˆš[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]

Here, "s" is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, i.e., s = (a + b + c)/2.
